This is a Machine Learning practice project. 
Given a dataset containing news titles and the body text that has been labelled ‘TRUE’ or ‘FALSE’, 
I created a model that can detect whether a news item is fake or genuine
I used the PassiveAggressiveClassifier of 'sklearn.linear_model' module to train the model
